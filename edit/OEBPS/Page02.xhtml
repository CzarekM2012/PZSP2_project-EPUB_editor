      <h1>Now you are on the second page.</h1>
      <p class="example">On the left you can see the basic editor. You can change the current style from the first drop-down list. Fragments of an epub affected by the style will be highlighted. Try choosing <b>p.example</b> - this paragraph will be highlighted.</p>
      <p>After you choose a style, you can change text font using a drop-down list and color using RGB sliders. Try changing <b>p.example</b> style of the paragraph above. If you do not like the new color, you can remove it with <b>remove color</b> button on the bottom.</p>
      <p>If you are familiar with css syntax, there is also an advanced editor. Go to <b>View -> Change view to text editor</b> (Ctrl + Alt + v). There you can see styles directly in the css file. If there are more stylesheets, you can change the one being edited using the drop-down list at the top of the screen. Changes are applied after clicking <b>save</b> button. If you want to return to the graphic editor, choose <b>View -> Change view to basic editor</b> (Ctrl + Alt + v).</p>
